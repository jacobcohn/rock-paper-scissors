I am creating Rock, Paper, Scissors. 
Wish me luck!

I just finished creating the game without a GUI.
I had to start from scratch at one point.
This project did give me a lot better understanding on Javascript.
I cannot wait for the next project!

I just finished the game with an extremely simple GUI.
I might come back and add some CSS to make it look better.
I learned a lot about the DOM and many other things (forEach).
